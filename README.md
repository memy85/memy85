## Hello~!
Hello! I am a PhD student at Miner School of Computer & Information Sciences, University of Massachusetts Lowell. Prior to studying computer science, I studied biomedical informatics at Yonsei University. I thought it would be nice to build an AI that could help people who were ill and who work in the healthcare domain. My goal is to build a very smart AI machine that can help people prevent disease and help clinicians make smart, fast and accurate decisions. If you have any questions using my code for commercial purpose or research projects or just to have fun, whatever it is, do not hesitate to contact me! You can get in touch with me via E-mail! Thank you!
